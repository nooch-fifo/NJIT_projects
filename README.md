# NJIT_projects is a compilation of my front/middle end files for the Online Python Exam System group project (Design in Software Engineering course, NJIT Summer 2020) 
I was the frontend developer for my NJIT senior group project - an Online Python Exam System for teachers and students to make, take, and grade a quiz. Used HTML5, CSS, and pure Javascript, while JSON and AJAX were used to parse JSON objects and for XMLHttpRequests respectively. Project was completed completely and a final grade of an A was received. 
It was ultimately a website on the NJIT servers that enables teachers to log-in, create questions for a Python quiz, filter through these questions saved in the database, then create a quiz with selected questions. As a student, one can then log-in to the system, take this Python quiz that was created by the teacher, and then submit to the teacher. The quiz then gets auto-graded, and the teacher can make respective edits and comments to the grade and submit the grading sheet back to the student. Lastly, the student can then see the calculated final grade and a detailed chart of points earned with comments made by the teacher.
